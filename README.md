This will be the codebase for the website for Pick Me Ups.

1) We will display store information about what is available at each store. For example, when you look for a key word "hand sanitizer", we will show which stores near you have it. 2) We will have sign up sheets and excel sheets to see what can be donated. 
3) We will include the matching process on getting them for older to younger people.
4) We will have a form to have younger people sign up
